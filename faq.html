		<h1>irc.perl.org: FAQ</h1>

		<h2>What is irc.perl.org</h2>
			<p>irc.perl.org is collection of IRC servers run by various members
			of the Perl community. It is home to hundreds of perl projects,
			modules and social channels. It is also home to a lot of not-perl
			projects and the like. We encourage polyglotism and, despite the
			name, welcome non-perl people too.</p>

		<h2>So what's MagNET?</h2>
			<p>This is MagNET. MagNET was the original name of the network, back
			when it was just a refuge from Efnet #perl. The network has also
			gone by "Rhizomatic".</p>

		<h2>Is this the official Perl network?</h2>
			<p>It seems so. Given the hostname and the amount of perl projects
			that live here, it's hard to argue otherwise.</p>

		<h2>Is #perl the official Perl channel?</h2>
			<p>No. The history of #perl is long and sordid but one truth
			remains: #perl is primarily a social channel for members of the Perl
			community. Advanced questions will often be answered but newbie-type
			questions are best asked in other channels.</p>

		<h2>Where can I get Perl help?</h2>
			<p>#perl-help, #perl on irc.libera.chat, #perl on
				irc.oftc.net, #perl on freenode.net</p>

		<h2>What other channels are available?</h2>
			<p>MagNET is home to hundreds of individual IRC channels.
				While it would be impossible to list and describe them all, we do maintain
				a <a href="channels.html">list of the more popular and potentially
				"official" channels</a> who make their home here.</p>

		<h2>Do you have a Standards / Code Of Conduct?</h2>
			<p>Yes! Users of irc.perl.org are bound by our <a
			href="rules.html">Standards of Conduct</a> under the terms of <a
			href="governance.html">our governance policies</a>.</p>
