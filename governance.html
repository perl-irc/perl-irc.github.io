		<h1>Governance of irc.perl.org</h1>

        <p>There has been a distinct lack of interest from the community in the
        governance of irc.perl.org, and until such time as the community shows
        interest by committing resources we are forced to use the following
        governance policy.</p>

        <h2>Opers</h2>

        <p>irc.perl.org has the following opers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>mst</li>
            <li>perigrin</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They have unilateral control over the network and enforcement of the
        <a href="rules.html">rules</a> as they best see fit. If you have a
        disagreement with the decision of one of them, you are welcome to
        appeal that decision to the other but understand they give each other
        wide latitude and can only resolve differences by finding
        consensus.</p>
