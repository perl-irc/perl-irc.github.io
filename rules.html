		<h1>Standards Of Conduct</h1>

		<h2>Network Access</h2>

		<p>You will be scanned via an automated process to check for various disallowed
		and insecure services. <b>The only way to opt-out of these scans is to not join
		the network.</b></p>

		<p>We participate in several blackhole lists with other IRC networks. If
		you have caused problems on other networks, there's a good chance our bots
		won't even let you on the network. We do not have the ability to remove you
		from these lists. </p>

		<p>Usage of this network is a privilege, not a right. Your access can be
		revoked at any time for any reason. The reason doesn't have to make sense to
		you and it doesn't have to be fair. General policies, however, are listed
		below.</p>

		<h2>Security And Liability</h2>

		<p>irc.perl.org attempts to run a safe and secure network. However, the security
		bots cannot catch everyone with ill intent and we cannot guarantee the security
		of a user's IRC client. We will respond with haste to any reported
		security related incident. That said, <b>irc.perl.org is not responsible or
		liable for the security or lack thereof surrounding your time on the
		network.</b></p>

		<p><u>Snowden Disclosures:</u> Due to the IRC server software we use, all
		channel traffic is propagated to all server nodes. The links between servers
		are encrypted, however, using cryptlink. You can prevent traffic from
		propagating by using a server-local channel. These are created using '&amp;'
		instead of '#'. All users will need to connect to the same server IP. </p>

		<p>We have never received any requests for user information and would
		probably wet ourselves laughing if we did.</p>

		<h2>Bot Policy</h2>

		<p>irc.perl.org tolerates all bot software with 2 major exceptions. The
		bots cannot: 1) disrupt the network. 2) disrupt channel activity. It is
		up to the discretion of the staff and channel ops to determine what
		constitutes "disruption". If you are asked to remove your bot from the
		network, it is expected you will act promptly with minimal fuss.
		Failure to do so may cause a revocation of your access to the network.

		<h2>Tor</h2>

		Tor is, sadly, <b>not</b> allowed on irc.perl.org. We support,
		conceptually, the pseudo-anonymity that Tor provides. The network,
		however, has come under attack via Tor often enough that exit nodes are
		blocked on site via network-wide klines.

		<h2>Personal Conduct</h2>

		<h3>Network Policies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Do</b>: obey the opers. See below for more.</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: engage in spamming</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: engage in flooding</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: evade bans or ignores</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: threaten another user or users with physical or
			network violence (including DDoS)</li>
			<li><b>Do Not</b>: attempt to host a botnet here.</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>We absolutely will not tolerate child pornography or any content
			that endangers minors.</b></li>
		</ul>

		<p>We will engage local authorities as necessary to deal with illegal
		content and activities. Yes, we have done this before.</p>

		<h3>Channel Logging</h3>

		<p>Channels on irc.perl.org are expected to be lively discussion/debate
		channels where people can, if appropriate to the topic, rant about the
		problems they're dealing with.</p>

		<p>Public logs can have a chilling effect on this purpose, because the
		knowledge of public visibility of your words to people outside of your
		community, and the potential for people to read such words without
		context, is likely to significantly restrict the free and frank exchange
		of views that characterises a healthy and effective open source
		project.</p>

		<p>Additionally, public logs are often misused as a source of "just do
		this" solutions in a way that the medium of IRC is simply not designed
		to provide, and can easily lead users into antipatterns due to lack of
		context leading to a misunderstanding as to the applicability of the
		advice to other problems.</p>

		<p>As such, while some channels choose to provide public logs, many do
		not, and public logging without (a) permission of the channel owners (b)
		a clear notification to users, usually via /topic, that logging will be
		taking place, is (as on Libera.Chat) considered to be a violation of
		network policy.</p>


		<h3>Community Policies</h3>

		<p><a href="reasonable_person.html">Reasonable person principle</a> applies.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Everyone will be reasonable.</li>
			<li>Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.</li>
			<li>No one is special.</li>
			<li>Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Additionally, please take note of the following:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
			<li>Alert the staff if you notice a dangerous situation or someone
			in distress.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning
		conduct are among the types of unreasonable behaviors deemed to be unacceptable.</p>

		<p>Harassing behavior includes, but is not limited to: offensive comments
		related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
		inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; deliberate
		intimidation, stalking or following; sustained disruption of channel
		activity; unwelcome sexual attention; ignore and/or ban evasion.</p>

		<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
		immediately.</p>

		<p>If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the opers may take any
		action they deem appropriate within the bounds of the
		<a href="governance.html">governance policies</a>. Initial violations or violations
		believed be unintentional, if not repeated, will likely only result in warnings.
		Repeated violations or intentional harassment will be met with increasingly
		severe responses.</p>


		<h3>Channels Specific Policies</h3>

		<p>Where they do not collide with network policy, individual channels
		can set their own standard of conduct. These policies must be made
		visible in such a way that new users  are made immediately aware of
		them when they join the channel. We suggest using the channel
		topic.</p>

		<h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

		<p>If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else
		is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
		please notify the Standards of Conduct Review Board (SRB) via #magnet-srb.
		Consult the <a href="governance.html">governance policies</a> as to the
		proper process.</p>

		<p>A full staff listing is available on <a href="staff.html">the staff
		page</a>.</p>
