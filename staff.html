		<h1>Staff</h1>

		<h2>Network Opers</h2>

		<p>These staff members run the servers and infrastructure for the
		network. They also form the incident response team for all network
		events including DDoS, bot incursions, and security issues. They are
		also the escalation point for all issues which the community opers
		cannot resolve.</p>

		<p>The network opers are the final word on network policies.</p>
