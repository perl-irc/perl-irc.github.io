		<h1>Staff</h1>

		irc.perl.org has two different types of stuff.

		<h2>Community Opers / SRB</h2>

		<p>Community opers interface with the user base and channel leadership.
		They also form the SRB, Standards Of Conduct Review Board, responsible
		for enforcing <a href="rules.html">the Standards Of Conduct</a> under
		the terms of the <a href="governance.html">governance policies</a>.</p>

		<p>Community opers are the final word on community policies and the
		standards of conduct. They, however, have no responsibility over network
		policy.</p>

		<h3>Members</h3>

			<li>perigrin</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Network Opers</h2>

		<p>These staff members run the servers and infrastructure for the
		network. They also form the incident response team for all network
		events including DDoS, bot incursions, and security issues. They are
		also the escalation point for all issues which the community opers
		cannot resolve.</p>

		<p>The network opers are the final word on network policies. Their
		individual behavior, however, is regulated by the SRB.</p>
